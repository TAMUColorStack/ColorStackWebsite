                        At Color Stack TAMU, we strive to cultivate the same sense of
                        community, support, and growth within our closely-knit Aggie
                        family. Our mission mirrors that of the <a class="about-us-link" href="https://www.colorstack.org/">national
                        organization</a> â€”providing academic guidance, career development,
                        and fostering meaningful connections among Black and Latinx
                        computer science students as they prepare for successful
                        technical careers after graduation.
