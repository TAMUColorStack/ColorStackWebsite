                At Color Stack TAMU, we strive to cultivate the same sense of
                community, support, and growth within our closely-knit Aggie
                family. Our mission mirrors that of the national
                organizationâ€”providing academic guidance, career development,
                and fostering meaningful connections among Black and Latinx
                computer science students as they prepare for successful
                technical careers after graduation.
